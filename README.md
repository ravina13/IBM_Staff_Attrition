# IBM_Staff_Attrition
My team members and I have designed a predictive model using logistic regression and observed that factors such as environment dissatisfaction, job dissatisfaction, overtime were the major reasons why employees were leaving the company. Having worked on this project gave insights on how the HR Department can build retention strategies based on data collected from exit interviews.

Key steps included the following
• Analyzing the responses of 1407 employee satisfaction surveys using R (ggplot2 package) to predict employee attrition for the 2016 fiscal year. 
• Processing of raw data to handle missing values and to obtain consistent records for further analysis. 
• Examining of patterns and highlighting insights on various possibilities of attrition using visualization techniques in R (Lattice) and Tableau. 
• Predicting future attrition and concluding variables that could possibly help build retention strategy by using logistic regression model.
