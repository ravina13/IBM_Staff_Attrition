# IBM Staff Attrition
The predictive model, designed by my team members and me, utilized logistic regression to identify key factors contributing to employee attrition within the company. Our analysis revealed that environmental dissatisfaction, job dissatisfaction, and overtime were significant drivers of employee turnover. Working on this project provided valuable insights for the HR Department, enabling them to develop data-driven retention strategies using information gathered from exit interviews.

Key steps included the following
- Analyzing the responses of 1407 employee satisfaction surveys using R (ggplot2 package) to predict employee attrition for the 2016 fiscal year. 
- Processing of raw data to handle missing values and to obtain consistent records for further analysis. 
- Examining patterns and highlighting insights on various possibilities of attrition using visualization techniques in R (Lattice) and Tableau. 
- Predicting future attrition and concluding variables that could possibly help build retention strategy by using a logistic regression model.
